# Sales Performance Dashboard

This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive web dashboard using **Plotly Dash** to visualize synthetic sales performance data. The dashboard allows users to filter data by product category and region, providing dynamic and actionable insights into sales trends and profitability.

## Features

* **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a sample dataset of sales records including date, region, product category, sales, profit, and units sold.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: A web-based dashboard built with Plotly Dash.
* **Multiple Visualizations**: Displays key metrics and trends using various chart types (e.g., line chart for sales over time, bar chart for sales by category, pie chart for profit by region).
* **Filtering Capabilities**: Allows users to interactively filter data by `Region` and `Product Category` using dropdowns.
* **Actionable Insights**: Designed to help identify top-performing areas, popular products, and profit distribution.

## Dashboard Preview

Here's a static preview of the interactive dashboard:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
     https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sales-performance-dashboard.git
    
    
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repo name if it's different)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### How to Run

1.  **Generate the dataset:**
    This script creates `sales_data.csv` in the project root.
    ```bash
    python data_generator.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Dash Dashboard:**
    This will start a local web server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`) where your interactive dashboard will be accessible.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Open the URL provided in your terminal in a web browser.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Future Enhancements

* **Real Dataset**: Integrate with a real-world sales dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or public APIs).
* **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate statistical models or machine learning predictions into the dashboard.
* **User Authentication**: Add user login capabilities for secure access.
* **Deployment**: Deploy the Dash app to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render).
* **Additional Interactivity**: Add more filter options (e.g., date range picker, multi-select dropdowns), cross-filtering, or drill-down capabilities.
* **Theming and Styling**: Enhance the visual appeal with custom CSS and Dash themes.
